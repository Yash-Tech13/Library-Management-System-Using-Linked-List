# Library Management System Using Linked List and File Handling

Nowadays everything is advanced like advanced technology, advanced apps, advanced systems and many more.
As a result, Library Management should be transformed into a Digital Library Management System in today's advanced digital environment.
In traditional libraries, students or users must search for books, which is a time-consuming procedure, and databases about concerns are not properly maintained. 
The general pace of work is slow, making it impossible to produce a timely report. 
Librarians must put in a lot of effort to organise and categorise books according to their titles and alphabets. 
As a result, it is a time-consuming and complex task. 
At the same time, they must review and monitor the details of the lend/borrow book, including the fine. 
Working in multiple areas at the same time is a time-consuming task.
As a result, the Library Management System (LMS) functions as a machine or tool that converts traditional libraries into digital libraries. 
LMS will make librarians' jobs easier, and the largest benefit of LMS is that customers won't have to wait in line for extended periods of time to exchange or borrow books from the library. 
Librarians may readily find any book in less time using the LMS. 
The C programming language is used throughout the Library Management System project.
